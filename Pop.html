  <p>In the 1990s, VR gained popularity largely through the efforts of companies like Virtuality Group and VPL Research, founded by Jaron Lanier. Virtuality Group developed arcade-style VR systems that allowed users to experience immersive virtual environments, while VPL Research created some of the earliest VR headsets and gloves for interactive experiences. Despite the limited technology of the time, their pioneering work captured the public's imagination and laid the foundation for future advancements in VR technology.</p>
