       <p>The military has utilized VR technology extensively for training purposes, offering soldiers realistic and immersive simulated environments to practice various scenarios without real-world risks. VR simulations allow troops to undergo training in diverse environments, from combat scenarios to vehicle operation, enhancing their readiness and decision-making skills in a controlled setting. By providing hands-on experience in lifelike conditions, VR training has proven to be a cost-effective and efficient method for military personnel to prepare for challenging situations they may encounter in the field.</p>
